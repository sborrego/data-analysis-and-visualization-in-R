# Data Analysis and Visualization in R
University of South Florida - Spring Workshop  
Monday, February 13, 2022  
9:00 - 10:30 am EST  

R is a beginner friendly programming language used for statistical computing and graphics. In this workshop, you will be introduced to basic data analysis in R and begin to explore data visualizations, one of the most power aspects of the R programming language. This workshop is the second of two R programming lessons and it is recommended to review material covered by the first workshop up to the section titled "MISSING DATA" - [R Programming: An Introduction](https://github.com/sborrego/r-programming-an-introduction/blob/main/R-programming-an-introduction.pdf). The second half of this document will be covered in this workshop.

## Install R and RStudio or get access on Posit (Formerly RStudio Cloud)

To participate in this workshop you will need to have access to the programming language R and RStudio - see the options below. Please be prepared and have R and RStudio setup using either method before the workshop. If you experience any trouble with installation, please contact me prior to the workshop **staceyborrego@gmail.com**.

### Option 1 - **recommended**

Accessing Rstudio on the cloud is an excellent alternative to installing it on your own computer. You will need to sign up for a free account on their website by following the instructions below. If you already have an accout with the RStudio Cloud, your credentials will still work on the Posit website.

Website: [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)  
- Click **Get Started** 
- Click **Sign Up**
- Provide the necessary information or log in if you have an account with RStudio Cloud
- Under *Your Workspace* on the left side, *Your Content* should be selected
- On the far right, under your name at the top, click on the blue **New Project** button, then **New RStudio Project**
- At the top you can *rename* the project by clicking on Untitled Project  

You are all set! This workspace will be saved and ready to access anytime in the future.

### Option 2

Another option is install all the software on your computer. You will need to install **BOTH** the R programming language and RStudio. If you already have R and RStudio installed, it is recommended to update both. Here is a link to great instructions for all operating systems for both installation and updating: [Installation Instructions](https://preview.carpentries.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html#install-r-and-rstudio)
